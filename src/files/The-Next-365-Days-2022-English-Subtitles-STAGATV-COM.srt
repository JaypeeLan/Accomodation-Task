25
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,840

Unfortunate <i>incident?</i>

Oh, excuse me.

28
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,200
I should have said, "after this tragedy."

29
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,200
She wouldn't be happy... seeing you crying.

30
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,440
Look, I'll tell you one time,
and I won't say it again.

00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,360
I've missed you so much.

48
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,680
It's too soon.

49
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,600
The doctor said that it's too soon.

50
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,440
I don't care what the doctor said.

51
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,360

52
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,520
Baby?

53
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,440
I know how I feel, and I know what I need.

54
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,880
And it's definitely not lying in a bed
and feeling sorry for myself.

55
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,200
Bang, bang!

56
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,080
No way! Look at you!

57
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,320
You made it downstairs!

58
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,080
But shouldn't you be resting?

59
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,520
What is it with you and resting?

60
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,840
I've had enough rest
to last me a lifetime.

61
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:32,360
I'm tired of lying in bed
and having you baby me.

62
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,480
Raquel,
please bring us a bottle of wine.

63
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,600
Ooh.

64
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,320
That's hardcore.
It's not even 11:00 yet.

65
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,080
That's bad, even for me.

66
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,360
Need I remind you that you almost died?

67
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,600
- Getting drunk at breakfast is a bad idea.
- For fuck's sake.

68
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,600
Why does everyone suddenly
think they know what I need?

69
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,960
Do you have any idea
what we've been through?

70
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,480
Thank you.

71
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,960
I've never been so afraid of losing you.

72
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
And Massimo...

73
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,600
...his heart nearly broke.

74
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:33,560
Olo, I know how hard it was for you
and I know you're worried about me,

75
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,120
but I've been given a second chance.

76
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,240
I want to make the most of it.

77
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,720
Besides, we haven't even toasted
to you changing your mind about marriage.

78
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,920
What?

79
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,080
Nothing.

80
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,840
I'm just happy you're here.

81
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,240

82
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,720
More, more, more alcohol.

83
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,560

84
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,320
Oof.

85
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,400

Well, just more to love.

184
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,480
Oof.

185
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,320

186
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,720

187
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,480
Wait a second, please.

188
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,080
Where did you get my number?

189
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,320
<i>You know... I am who I am.</i>

190
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,040

191
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,440

192
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,920
Why are you calling?

193
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,120
<i>'Cause... I can't forget about you.</i>

194
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,480
So, try harder.

195
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,840
Who was that?

196
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,880
- How was everything?
- Great. Thanks.

197
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,960
Thank you.

198
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,960
Tell me the truth.

199
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,760
Olo, sometimes the truth is complicated.

200
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,880
Lari, what happened on that island?

201
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,800
- He was just different.
- Who?

202
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,880
Nacho.

203
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,760
I ran away with him
after Massimo cheated with Anna.

204
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,840
Hold on. I thought
that was a plot against Massimo.

205
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,200
It was,
but I didn't know it at the time.

206
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,440
Nacho was like my... best friend.

207
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,360
Seriously? You saw the guy twice,
and now he's your best friend?

208
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,320
Whatever. I'm not here to lecture you.

209
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,800
Sure sounds like it.

210
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,560
Did you sleep with him?

211
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,720
No.

212
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,240
But he was there for me
when my whole world was falling apart.

213
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,240
He took care of me, and I felt free.

214
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,240
Okay.

215
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,600
I have to forget about him.

216
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,680

217
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,360
You're in love with him.

218
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,880

665
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:28,280

- Stop it.

666
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:32,560

- I'll shield you with my body.

Laura.

991
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:30,520

- Told me what?

When Anna shot you instead of Massimo,
she tried to shoot him again.

998

I didn't allow it. I killed her.

1027
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:49,800
I'm one step away
from asking you for a divorce.

1028
01:16:52,360 --> 01:16:53,360
Divorce?

1029
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:01,080

1034
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:16,480
I'm talking to you. I'm talking to you.

1035
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:25,760
When I got shot,
our relationship almost died with me.

1036
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:29,760
I was trying to save it,
and you, you were speculating

1037
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:33,240
and diving into your dark limbo,
which I was not allowed to enter.

1038
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:36,240
Now I'm in my own limbo.

1039
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:39,400
I don't know what I want,
but I'm alone there.

1040
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:46,960
And I need space to find out what I feel.

1041
01:17:47,560 --> 01:17:48,760
Can you stop?

1042
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:51,960

01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:01,440

01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:03,440

1045
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:05,000
There's no us.

1046

1048
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:22,440
I'm going to sleep in Olga's room tonight.

1049
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:26,080
And I expect you
to leave for Sicily tomorrow

1050
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:28,080
to give me the time and space I need.

1051
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:32,240

01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:46,120
Whoo!

1057
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:48,600
Well played.

1058
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:51,120
You managed to lock this tiger in a cage.

1059
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:56,560
Fucking hell.

1060
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,720
Have you completely lost
your fucking mind?

1061
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:02,160
You've gone crazy
for some dick you hardly know

1062
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:04,440
just because he makes you wet?

1063
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:07,040
What now, Lari? Hmm?

1064
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:12,080
Well? Are you going to break up
your marriage and family for him?

1065
01:21:12,160 --> 01:21:13,560
I can't believe it.

1066
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:16,800
You haven't married Domenico yet,

1067
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:19,040
and you're already acting
like a Torricelli.

1068
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:22,600
Spare me the bullshit
about family loyalty.

1069
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:24,800
What am I supposed to do?

1070
01:21:25,320 --> 01:21:28,880
Wait until Massimo deals with his shit
and remembers I'm his wife?

1071
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:35,120
Who are you looking out for?
Me or yourself?

1072
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:39,640
Just leave me alone.

1073
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
I have to figure out what I really want.

1074
01:21:51,080 --> 01:21:52,080
You're right.

1075
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:02,680
I'm sorry I didn't ask how you're feeling,
or if you need anything.

1076
01:22:10,680 --> 01:22:13,040
Lari, look at me.

1077
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:15,960
Look at me.

1078
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:21,800
I love you.

1079
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:27,400
I want you to be happy.

1080
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:32,720
Whatever you decide,
I'll support you. You hear me?

1081
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:38,320
I'm just worried.

1082
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:42,800
Come here.

1083
01:22:55,240 --> 01:22:56,560
Watch out for my snot.

1084
01:22:58,080 --> 01:23:01,320
Remember, just say the word,
and I'll fucking kill both of them.

1085
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:08,040
And I'll find you a nice, calm guy
from a village near Radom, okay?

1086
01:23:09,160 --> 01:23:10,480
That's right.

1087
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:11,880
What?

1088
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:15,080
You'll grow old and die of boredom.

1089
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:26,920
Honey?

1090
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:28,160
Hi, Dad.

1091
01:23:30,440 --> 01:23:31,560
Hi, sweetie!

1092
01:23:34,680 --> 01:23:36,600
I've missed riding with you.

1093
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:39,920
Jesus, Laura, did something happen?

1094
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,480
You came here on a motorcycle?

1095
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:45,800
You're gonna give me a heart attack.

1096
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:49,680
You know how much I hate your escapades.

1097
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:51,560
Happy to see you too, Mom.

1098
01:23:54,440 --> 01:23:56,160
Come in. I've got some pork chops.

1099
01:23:58,200 --> 01:24:00,000
Of course, you never call ahead.

1100
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:04,880
You could have told me you were coming.

1101
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:06,760
I would have prepared.

1102
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:10,280
I always have to think on my feet.

1103
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,760
Honey, what's going on?

1104
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:40,920
What do you mean? Nothing's going on.
I'm just here to visit you.

1105
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:44,480
Your mom is convinced
that people buy motorcycles

1106
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:47,760
when they're going through
some kind of crisis.

1107
01:24:50,080 --> 01:24:52,720
Honey, you'll be 30 soon.

1108
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:57,000
If you were okay, you'd be spending
your birthday with your husband,

1109
01:24:57,080 --> 01:24:59,800
celebrating the anniversary
of your first meeting.

1110
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:02,480
- As far as I know...
- I'm in love with someone else.

1111
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:13,480
Uh...

1112
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:14,640
His name is Nacho.

1113
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:18,920
Honey, get me a cigarette.

1114
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:23,560
But we agreed
that we wouldn't smoke anymore.

1115
01:25:23,640 --> 01:25:25,960
Please, bring me a cigarette!

1116
01:25:29,480 --> 01:25:30,480

01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:29,880
The problem is, I don't know.

I'll tell you
a little secret.

1140
01:26:58,920 --> 01:27:03,360
I think it's what's kept
our marriage alive for 35 years.

1141
01:27:05,640 --> 01:27:11,000
Remember, a woman
must be selfish in a relationship.

1142
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:14,960
If you put your own happiness first,

1143
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:18,080
you'll do whatever it takes
to make it last, right?

1144
01:27:18,840 --> 01:27:20,840
You will cherish your relationship.

1145
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:22,440
Mm.

1146
01:27:22,520 --> 01:27:25,440
But it can't be
a relationship that destroys you.

1147
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:32,160
Remember that a woman
who lives only for her man

1148
01:27:33,680 --> 01:27:35,440
will always be unhappy.

1149
01:27:37,240 --> 01:27:38,240
Yeah.

1150
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:41,200

- I've noticed.
- Hmm.

1217
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:47,640
There are two things
you never point out to a woman.

1218
01:31:47,720 --> 01:31:48,720
What things?

1219
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:51,280
Her age and the amount of food she eats.

1220
01:31:51,880 --> 01:31:53,680
I never knew about the second one.

1221
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:56,320
- You should.
- Okay, I'll keep that in mind.

1222
01:32:00,760 --> 01:32:01,760
Excuse me.

1223
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:07,280
- Just a second. Olga won't stop calling.
- Okay.

1224
01:32:19,440 --> 01:32:20,640
How's everything?

1225
01:32:20,720 --> 01:32:21,976
- Good, thanks.
- Great.

1226
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:46,520

or I'll have a heart attack.

01:32:46,600 --> 01:32:48,400
Jeez, Olo, relax. What's up?

1228
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:50,200
<i>You want to know what's up?</i>

1229
01:32:50,280 --> 01:32:54,520
Massimo knows about everything, Lari.
He knows about you and Nacho!

1230
01:32:54,600 --> 01:32:56,960
He's gonna kill you,
me, and God knows who else!

1231
01:32:57,040 --> 01:32:58,600
Um, he told you that?

1232
01:32:59,200 --> 01:33:02,600
No, I overheard him
talking to Domenico.

1233
01:33:03,480 --> 01:33:07,080
Um, how did you know
what they were talking about?

1234
01:33:07,160 --> 01:33:08,400
You don't speak Italian.

1235
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:09,960
<i>Maybe you don't.</i>

1236
01:33:10,040 --> 01:33:13,400
But I was pissed off
about not understanding, so I learned.

1237
01:33:13,480 --> 01:33:17,080
Maybe I'm not a fluent speaker,
but I understand everything.

1238
01:33:17,160 --> 01:33:19,280
You know how to say, "Nacho fucked Laura"?

1239
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:21,320
<i>"Nacho ha scopato Laura."</i>

1240
01:33:23,400 --> 01:33:25,280
I guess it's time to go back to Sicily.

1241
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:28,680
Are you fucking insane? He knows!

1242
01:33:28,760 --> 01:33:30,680
Shoot! Fuck knows what he's gonna do!

1243
01:33:30,760 --> 01:33:32,960
<i>Fuck. I just said, "shoot."</i>

1244
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:36,720
I'd rather him shoot himself
than you or me.

1245
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:41,440
Olo, stop. There must be a reason
he hasn't done anything about it yet.

1246
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:46,680
Are you even listening to me?
Massimo won't forgive cheating.

1247
01:33:46,760 --> 01:33:47,840
<i>- Listen.</i>
- Shit.

1248
01:33:47,920 --> 01:33:51,520
I'm not scared of my own husband.
I won't hide from him.

1249
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:55,000
I'm coming back.

1250
01:33:56,160 --> 01:34:02,120
Do what you want.
I'm working on... an escape plan.

1251
01:34:03,200 --> 01:34:05,280
Olo, relax. Have a cigarette, okay?

1252
01:34:05,360 --> 01:34:08,840
What the hell do you think I'm doing?
I can't stop smoking!

1253
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:11,520
Okay, bye.

1254
01:34:24,160 --> 01:34:26,200
Dad, I have to go back to Sicily.

1255
01:34:26,760 --> 01:34:27,760
Okay.

1256
01:34:29,720 --> 01:34:33,240
But first, let's go back to the table.
I ordered some apple pie.

1257
01:34:34,040 --> 01:34:35,080
Come on.

1258
01:35:10,520 --> 01:35:11,800
English, please.

1259
01:35:25,320 --> 01:35:26,680
Mr. Fabio Rossi,

1260
01:35:28,040 --> 01:35:31,040
what did you not understand
when I told you not to push me?

1261
01:35:36,840 --> 01:35:37,840
Laura...

1262
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:44,080
by coming here, I'm risking my life
and also my father's life in business.

1263
01:35:44,160 --> 01:35:47,920
We have a pact with Massimo
not to enter his territory.

1264
01:35:48,720 --> 01:35:49,960
And you know what?

1265
01:35:50,760 --> 01:35:52,000
I didn't give a fuck...

1266
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:54,880
because I needed to see you.

1267
01:35:59,320 --> 01:36:00,320
Bee...

1268
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:03,840
Please.

1269
01:36:06,160 --> 01:36:09,080
Hear me out, and then do what you want.

1270
01:36:10,280 --> 01:36:11,360
As you always do.

1271
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:21,560
Okay, Mr. Fabio Rossi. Let's go.

1272
01:36:23,080 --> 01:36:26,600
You know the address.
You used to work there as a gardener.

1273
01:36:44,080 --> 01:36:46,920
I've already apologized for that.

1274
01:36:48,040 --> 01:36:49,040
I will do it again.

1275
01:36:51,400 --> 01:36:53,040
You wanted to tell me something.

1276
01:36:55,400 --> 01:36:56,400
Okay.

1277
01:36:58,160 --> 01:36:59,680
I want to be honest with you.

1278
01:37:06,080 --> 01:37:07,240
Since I met you...

1279
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:12,800
I understand what it means
to be best friends with your lover.

1280
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,040
I didn't fall in love with you
at first sight.

1281
01:37:19,040 --> 01:37:20,680
I came to like you first.

1282
01:37:23,120 --> 01:37:24,520
For the way you get angry...

1283
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:27,840
the way you squint your eyes.

1284
01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:33,240
For being so stubborn.

1285
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:36,840
I love looking at you.

1286
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:40,800
When you sleep.

1287
01:37:42,640 --> 01:37:44,640
When you smile
without a reason.

1288
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:48,560
When you brush your teeth...

1289
01:37:50,240 --> 01:37:51,360
and raise one leg.

1290
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:54,840
I want it all, Laura.

1291
01:37:58,480 --> 01:38:02,960
I wanna discover new things with you.
I wanna show you the sunrise in Burma.

1292
01:38:04,040 --> 01:38:06,040
I wanna meditate with you in Bali.

1293
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:09,200
And get drunk with you in Tokyo.

1294
01:38:12,760 --> 01:38:16,280
I know it sounds silly, but...

1295
01:38:19,320 --> 01:38:22,680
I have no idea
when you became my world, Laura.

1296
01:38:23,400 --> 01:38:24,560
I can't help it.

1297
01:38:29,040 --> 01:38:33,520
I can't live without this world,
and I don't want to.

1298
01:38:35,120 --> 01:38:37,080
I don't know how to convince you.

1299
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:40,760
I'm ready to give you everything.

1300
01:38:41,800 --> 01:38:44,160
Whatever you want from me.

1301
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:56,840
Thank you for finding the courage
to tell me all of this.

1302
01:38:58,240 --> 01:38:59,960
I know it wasn't easy.

1303
01:39:03,560 --> 01:39:05,520
But I also need to speak with Massimo.

1304
01:39:09,040 --> 01:39:11,360
I can't stay in that situation anymore.

1305
01:39:22,400 --> 01:39:23,400
Nacho...

1306
01:39:27,120 --> 01:39:28,520
I need more time.

1307
01:39:50,080 --> 01:39:51,080
I will wait.

1308
01:40:50,120 --> 01:40:51,320
You're here!

1309
01:40:55,680 --> 01:40:58,240
Okay. I packed just one suitcase.

1310
01:40:58,320 --> 01:41:01,040
I grabbed your stuff too.
It'll be a quick escape.

1311
01:41:01,120 --> 01:41:03,280
Why the fuck didn't you call or text?

1312
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:05,320
I would've sent a driver for you.

1313
01:41:05,400 --> 01:41:08,280
My driver was really nice.

1314
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:12,200
Are you serious? Now's not the best time...

1315
01:41:12,280 --> 01:41:13,280
Fuck.

1316
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:21,880
Are you fucking crazy?

1317
01:41:28,480 --> 01:41:31,800
Have you forgotten your husband's
line of work?

1318
01:41:31,880 --> 01:41:34,120
Why don't you bring him with you,

1319
01:41:34,760 --> 01:41:37,560
and I'll look up how to send
a dead body back to Poland?

1320
01:41:45,520 --> 01:41:46,760
Happy birthday.

1321
01:41:50,840 --> 01:41:54,440
God, it's so sad.
You're going to die on your birthday.

1322
01:41:55,440 --> 01:41:57,200
Happy birthday, Lari!

1323
01:41:59,280 --> 01:42:01,440
If you survive,
I bought you a really nice bag.

1324
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:03,200
If something happens, I'll keep it.

1325
01:42:03,280 --> 01:42:04,840
- Olo...
- Yeah?

1326
01:42:04,920 --> 01:42:05,920
Where's Massimo?

1327
01:42:09,280 --> 01:42:10,960
He went to the beach.

1328
01:42:13,520 --> 01:42:16,000
- Okay, I'll go find him.
- Really?

1329
01:42:16,520 --> 01:42:18,360
We need to work things out.

1330
01:42:20,760 --> 01:42:24,280
And when I get back,
we'll drink to my resurrection, okay?

1331
01:42:26,600 --> 01:42:28,240
- I have to go now.
- Yeah.

1332
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:32,960
- Olo...
- Yeah?

1333
01:42:33,560 --> 01:42:37,480
- I'm doing this alone.
- Oh yeah, alone. I'll stay here and wait.

1334
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:46,400
Fuck...

1335
01:43:00,400 --> 01:43:02,120
I'll just sit and wait.

1336
01:43:04,880 --> 01:43:06,600
Lari will be okay on her own.

1337
01:43:43,400 --> 01:43:44,640
Massimo...

1338
01:43:46,200 --> 01:43:47,280
We need to talk.

1339
01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:50,840
Let me start.

1340
01:43:59,280 --> 01:44:01,800
This conversation will be
much more difficult for me.

1341
01:44:02,320 --> 01:44:03,640
- Massimo...
- Wait.

1342
01:44:04,240 --> 01:44:05,920
I have to say it all now.

1343
01:44:06,600 --> 01:44:09,680
Otherwise, I'm afraid
I'm never gonna be able to say it again.

1344
01:44:13,160 --> 01:44:15,200
That time changed my life.

1345
01:44:18,080 --> 01:44:19,800
Not only because I had you,

1346
01:44:21,080 --> 01:44:25,040
but also because I realized
what I really want for myself.

1347
01:44:32,080 --> 01:44:33,640
I thought I could...

1348
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:42,280
I didn't want to be bad.

1349
01:44:45,440 --> 01:44:47,200
I can't forgive myself

1350
01:44:47,920 --> 01:44:51,760
that you didn't feel to come to me anymore
after losing our baby.

1351
01:44:56,600 --> 01:44:59,280
That you had to deal with it all alone,

1352
01:45:00,920 --> 01:45:02,640
it has destroyed me...

1353
01:45:03,360 --> 01:45:04,360
you...

1354
01:45:05,600 --> 01:45:06,600
us.

1355
01:45:08,440 --> 01:45:12,280
So you knew everything about Nacho
for a long time, didn't you?

1356
01:45:14,480 --> 01:45:16,360
Why didn't you do anything?

1357
01:45:32,240 --> 01:45:35,040
When I was a child,
my dad used to read me a book.

1358
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:43,000
I still remember one sentence,
a little parable.

1359
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:51,600
I didn't really understand it back then.

1360
01:45:55,520 --> 01:45:56,520
But now I do.

1361
01:46:05,400 --> 01:46:07,400
"If you really love something...

1362
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:11,640
just let it go."

1363
01:46:15,440 --> 01:46:18,000
"If it comes back, it's yours forever."

1364
01:46:21,200 --> 01:46:22,240
"If it doesn't...

1365
01:46:25,280 --> 01:46:26,840
it was never meant to be."

1366
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:34,800
Your dad was a wonderful father.

1367
01:46:38,680 --> 01:46:40,400
